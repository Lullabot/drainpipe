## Code Review Guidelines

When summarizing and reviewing code:

 * Write succinctly and directly without verbosity.
 * Target a high school reading level, but prefer correctness to simple language.
 * Do not duplicate information already included in the pull request description.
 * Do not restate code that is available within the pull request diff.
 * If feedback is provided on a line, that feedback does not need to be repeated in the summary.
